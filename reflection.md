- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I enjoyed using inheritance in this assigment. In a way it helps keep my code more organized because I do not need to re write parts that are repetitive (all the building had a name, address and number of floors.)

Update after A7: I initially got confused about overloading. I finally understood when I wanted a method in the Cafe class to be able to sell more than one cup of coffee at a time. For the other two classes I just overloaded the constructors. I would advice someone taking this course in the future to always go back to the class slides. Those helped me have a clearer understanding of the concepts of overriding and overloading methods.
